#abstract:
Not only Toronto but the whole world is suffering from the Coronavirus; hence we are thinking about under this challenging situation, is there anything the public can do to reduce the probability of being infected. This paper explores the dataset of COVID-19 Cases in Toronto in 2020, which contains all confirmed and probable cases and is managed by Toronto Public Health since the first case was reported in January 2020. We find that most patients above 80 years old are infected from Toronto health care settings while the young are mostly infected from close contact. Our findings are highly instructive for future epidemic related policies by implementing specific policy on a particular age group.
